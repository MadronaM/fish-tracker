# Fish Behavior and Tracking Analysis

This project is a React app that analyzes fish behavior in a waterbody. An interactive map of fish locations on Black Pine Lake explores the movements of collected and not collected fish with Acoustic and PIT tags. The map is created using Leaflet.js, with data fetched from an NDJSON file generated by a Python script that parses and wrangles the datasets. An interactive chart visualizes statistics of the released and tagged fish, built and animated with D3.js.

## Project Overview

- **Data Processing:** The dataset is processed using `data_processing.py`, which generates NDJSON files stored in `public/data/`.
- **Frontend:** The React app fetches and visualizes the data in `FishMap.js` (map) and `FishChart.js` (bar chart).
- **Mapping & Animation:** The app uses Leaflet.js for mapping and D3.js for animations.
- **Filtering & Customization:** Users can filter fish by species, collection status, and confidence levels.

## Running the Project
### Option 1: View the Built App

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MadronaM/fish-tracker
2. Navigate into the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd fish-tracker
3. In the project directory, run:
    ```bash
    npx serve -s build
4. Open the URL it provides (usually http://localhost:3000 or a different port)

### Option 2: Run the Development Server

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
3. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser

### Option 3: Rebuild the App

1. Run the data processing script:
   ```bash
   python backend/data_processing.py
2. Build the React app:
   ```bash
   npm run build
3. View the static files in a browser with a simple HTTP server:
    ```bash
    npx serve -s build
4. Open the URL it provides (usually http://localhost:3000 or a different port)
